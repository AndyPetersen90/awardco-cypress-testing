Taking Notes because this is all new to me.

We can use cy.get() to select an element based on its class. 
Then we can use the .type() command to enter text into the selected input. 
Finally, we can verify that the value of the input reflects the text that was 
typed with another .should().

// cy.contains("type").click();

// .type("fake@email.com")
// .should("have.value", "fake@email.com");

// Should be on a new URL which
// includes '/commands/actions'
// cy.url().should("include", "/commands/actions");

// Get an input, type into it and verify
// that the value has been updated

// cy.origin('www.acme.com', () => {
//   cy.visit('/history/founder')
//     cy.get('h1').contains('About our Founder, Marvin Acme') // 👍
//   })
